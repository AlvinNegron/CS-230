Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client wants us to create a drawing game, the teams will look at a picture that slowly renders in. It should take 30 seconds for the picture to be fully rendered in. There are four rounds and each round is one minute long, if noones guesses the answer then the other teams will be allowed 15 seconds to guess. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a good job describing the program and what we needed to implement for it to be completed. I did a good job strategizing and choosing what the best platform is and what the best language to use is.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Completing the document allowed for me to have a plan set while developing the code. It gave me an oversight of what I want and what the client wants and how the program should run.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part I would revise is the design constraints, I feel like I could have went into a bit more detial and included some more constraints. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user is the one that is going to be using the program, you are just designing it and writing it so considering your user needs for the program is very important.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the designing software by looking at the document and deciding what design is the best fit, I will probably use the same strategies that I used here which was creating a document will all the design constraints and all the other requirements.
